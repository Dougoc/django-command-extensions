= RunProfileServer =

_First of all; we recommend that before you start profiling any language or framework you learn enough about it so that you feel comfortable with digging into it's internals.  Without sufficient knowledge it will not only be (very) hard but your likely to make wrong assumptions (and fixes). As a rule of thumb, clean well written code will help you a lot more then overzealous micro-optimizations will._

_This document is work in progress. If you feel you can help with better/clearer or additional information about profiling Django please leave a comment._

= Introduction =

*runprofileserver* starts Django's runserver command with hotshot/profiling tools enabled.

It wil save .prof files containing the profiling information into the --prof-path directory.
Be careful that for each request made, one profile data file is created.

So please use something else then the default --prof-path=/tmp unless you want a really big and messy /tmp directory. (Yes this is probably a bug on windows systems. Where /tmp does not exist)

== gather_profile_stats.py ==

Django comes packed with a tool to aggregate these different prof files into one aggregated profile file. This tool is called _gather_profile_stats.py_ and is located inside the _bin_ directory of your Django distribution.
