#summary RunServerPlus-typical runserver with Werkzeug debugger baked in

= Introduction =

This item requires that you have the [http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/ Werkzeug WSGI utilities] installed.  Included with Werkzeug is a kick ass debugger that renders nice debugging tracebacks and adds an AJAX based debugger (which allows to execute code in the context of the tracebackâ€™s frames).  Additionally it provides a nice access view to the source code.

= Getting Started =

To get started we just use the `runserver_plus` command instead of the normal `runserver` command:

{{{
python manage.py runserver_plus

 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
 * Restarting with reloader...
Validating models...
0 errors found

Django version 0.97-newforms-admin-SVN-unknown, using settings 'screencasts.settings'
Development server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Using the Werkzeug debugger (http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/)
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
}}}

Note: all normal runserver options apply.  In other words, if you need to change the port number or the host information, you can do so like you would normally.


= Using =

Whenever we hit an exception in our code, instead of the normal Django traceback page appearing, we see the Werkzeug traceback page instead.
