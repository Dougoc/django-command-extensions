= Download and installation =

== Packages ==

Download the latest packaged version from http://code.google.com/p/django-command-extensions/ and unpack it. Inside is a script called setup.py. Enter this command:

{{{
python setup.py install
}}}

...and the package will install automatically.

== Version Control (Subversion and Mercurial) ==

Alternatively, source code can be accessed by performing a Subversion checkout or a Mercurial clone. For example, the following command will check the application's source code out to a django-command-extensions directory:

Subversion:
{{{
svn checkout http://django-command-extensions.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-command-extensions
}}}
Mercurial:
{{{
hg clone http://hgsvn.trbs.net/django-command-extensions
}}}
_For more information about Mercurial see MercurialGateway wiki page_

Add the resulting folder to your PYTHONPATH or symlink (junction, if you're on Windows) the extensions directory inside it into a directory which is on your PYTHONPATH, such as your Python installation's site-packages directory.

{{{
ln -sf /full/path/to/django-command-extensions/extensions /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/extensions
}}}

You can verify that the application is available on your PYTHONPATH by opening a Python interpreter and entering the following commands:

{{{
>>> import extensions
>>> extensions.VERSION
(0, 3, 'pre')
}}}

Keep in mind that the current code in SVN trunk may be different from the packaged release, and may contain bugs and backwards-incompatible changes, as well as new goodies to play with.
